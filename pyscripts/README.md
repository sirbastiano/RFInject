# Python Scripts

This folder contains Python scripts for project utilities and automation.

Examples:
- Data processing and analysis scripts
- Model training and evaluation scripts
- Command-line interface (CLI) entry points
- Data download and preprocessing utilities
- Experiment runners and benchmarking tools
- Utility functions and helper scripts

Note: Bash/shell scripts should be placed in the `scripts/` folder instead.

## Usage

Most Python scripts in this folder can be run directly:

```bash
python pyscripts/script_name.py [arguments]
```

Or if they have a shebang and are executable:

```bash
./pyscripts/script_name.py [arguments]
```
